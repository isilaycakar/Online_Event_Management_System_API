## Project Description
- The aim of the project is to create an online event management system where organizers can create events 
and participants can view and apply for these events. 
- For the events where there are ticket sales, the related events will be shared with different
online sales channels but, no ticket sales will be made through this system.
- Users cannot use the system's functionality without being a member.
- Users can create events on the system and participate in the created events.
- Users define the activities they want to organize by entering the necessary information.
- Users can see the defined activities in the system and participate in the activity they want.

integrated into the system and are redirected to their website.
